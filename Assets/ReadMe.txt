I have tested the joystick/controller calibration with an XBox 360 game controller, an old RealFlight Interlink Plus controller, a DRX T-Six Orange RC Transmitter, and a Graupner MZ-12 Transmitter.  Control works best with rc transmitter type controllers.  FYI, the radio transmitters need a usb dongle to work.  I also had to wire a switch into the DRX to get it to work.

There's a checkbox to turn on gamepad control from the Calibration panel if you want to use a gamepad.  Flying with a gamepad is a little clunky.  

If there's no joystick type controller connected, keyboard and mouse control is also available but it's even more clunky than the gamepad. Keys:  W,S for throttle;  A, D for yaw;  I, K for pitch;  J, L for roll.  The mouse will also do pitch and roll.

Everything is mode 2, meaning the throttle is on the left.  I only have mode 2 radios.

If crash detection or auto restart are off, pressing the spacebar will reset the drone.

If the drone get's so stuck that the spacebar won't set it right, try Ctl-Alt-Shift S to reset the drone and move it to the starting position.

Flight settings and timed race settings are available by clicking on the sprocket in the upper right corner of the flight window.

Clicking the Start Race button will place the drone at the starting position and start counting down.  When the countdown is complete a green light will start flashing on the first gate you're supposed to fly through.  Gates you haven't flown through will have red lights.  Gates you have flown through will have yellow lights.  When you pass through a gate with a green flashing light the light on the next gate you're suppose to fly through will start flashing green.
